        The Delhi government on Saturday filed a police case against the Sir
        Ganga Ram Hospital in the city for violating rules for coronavirus tests
        amid a growing controversy surrounding COVID-19 hospitals in the
        capital. The First Information Report or FIR was filed against unknown
        functionaries at the private hospital on a complaint by the Deputy
        Secretary of the Delhi government's Health Department. According to the
        complaint, while the government had made it mandatory for registering
        coronavirus tests on an official software programme, authorities at the
        Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) were not doing so. It was found that the
        RT-PCR app, developed by the central government, was not being used even
        on June 3 at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, the complaint alleged.
        Hospitals are required to register COVID-19 tests through the app so
        that the data on coronavirus patients is reflected in real-time in the
        government database and there is no duplication or error. Authorities at
        the SGRH, a leading private hospital and a dedicated COVID-19 facility,
        said the lapse was an oversight and that it had already responded to a
        show-cause notice sent by the Delhi government. "There was an error on
        our part. During lockdown when we started testing, we were understaffed.
        It was an oversight. Delhi government had issued show cause notice for
        not reporting on RT-PCR app and we have responded to them already. We
        hope this issue is settled soon," Dr DS Rana, chairman of Sir Ganga Ram
        Hospital told NDTV.
